A small, but perfectly formed boilerplate for React projects.

## Features

- Webpack 3, Babel, ES6, all set up ready to go
- Jest testing framework
- Uses React Helmet to easily amend the document head
- Webpack Hot Reloading (for SCSS anyway)
- Webpack Code splitting for App / Vendor bundles
- SMACSS structured SCSS
- PostCSS Autoprefixer
- Normalize.css

## Getting Started

First, clone the repo.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:nath-codes/react-babel-webpack-boilerplate.git yourAwesomeApp
$ cd yourAwesomeApp
```

Then ditch the existing .git history and initialize a new one.

``` bash
rm -rm .git
git init
```

Install the dependencies.

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Fire up the app.

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Head on over to localhost:8080 and you're good to go.
